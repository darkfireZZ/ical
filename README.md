# `ical`

`ical` is a Rust library for generating iCalendar files (as specified in [RFC
5545](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545)).
It currently lacks many features (it doesn't do much at all, really).

I might also add support for parsing iCalendar files in the future.

## Usage

See the documentation.
You can generate the documentation by running
```sh
cargo doc --open
```
